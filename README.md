I am an aspiring developer, my end goal is to make games so right now working in C, gamemaker, Unity, and HTML/CSS as well.
I want to build up a solid technical knowledge base as well, I have heard time and time again to do computer science over any
game design degree. I have designs on such a degree when the two years I am spending abroad are done, right now I am learning programming, design and developing skills in-between travelling and working full time.
I am currently living abroad, this great change in my life has inspired me to finally start doing this; at ten years old I 
wanted to make games, a life of worry and anxiousness had stopped me up until now.

That worry is still with me, but I've finally spent enough time doing what I thought I ought to, enough to get fed up with the idea.

Time to do what I want, time to create.
